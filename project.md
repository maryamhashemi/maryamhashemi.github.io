## Sudoku
In this project, we aimed to solve the sudoku puzzles we have extracted from images. First, we used computer vision algorithms and methods like Canny algorithm and contour to extract sudoku puzzles. Second, we used the classification method especially SVM and KNN to detect numbers in filled cells of puzzles. Finally, we solved sudoku using Backtracking algorithm and we illustrated the solution on the original image. For more information, visit [this](https://github.com/maryamhashemi/Sudoku).
