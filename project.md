## Sudoku
In this project, we aimed to solve the sudoku puzzles we have extracted from images. First, we used computer vision algorithms and methods like Canny algorithm and contour to extract sudoku puzzles. Second, we used the classification method especially SVM and KNN to detect numbers in filled cells of puzzles. Finally, we solved sudoku using Backtracking algorithm and we illustrated the solution on the original image. For more information, visit [this](https://github.com/maryamhashemi/Sudoku).

## Sentiment Analysis
As a project for Natural Language Processing course, we implement sentiment analysis on instagram comments about Minister of Communications and Information Technology through few years with C# and python using Nhazm toolkit for POS tagging.

## mallet
comparison between  Naive Bayes and MaxEntropy using mallet tool for Natural Language Processing course. For more information, visit [this](https://github.com/maryamhashemi/mallet).

## Wordmap
create a wordmap between politics News & sports News for Natural Language Processing course. in the following, we implement Naive Bayes to classify these two types of news. Finally, we also use vopalWabbit tool for classification. For more information, visit [this](https://github.com/maryamhashemi/wordmap).
