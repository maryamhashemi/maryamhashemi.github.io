Hi there!

I’m currently a PhD student specializing in the `Synergy of Large Language Model (LLM) Reasoning` and `Reinforcement Learning (RL)` at [Iran University of Science and Technology](http://www.iust.ac.ir/). My research is supervised by [Dr. Sauleh Eetemadi](http://www.sauleh.ir/) and [Dr. Nasser Mozayeni](https://webpages.iust.ac.ir/mozayani/).

Previously, I completed my master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence at the same university, where my main research interest focused on `Visual Question Answering(VQA)` and `Vision-and-Language Model(VLM)`. 

During my undergraduate studies, I earned my bachelor's degree at Iran University of Science and Technology, ranking among the top five students in my program.
