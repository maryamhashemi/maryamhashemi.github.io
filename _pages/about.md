Hi there!

I'm a master's student in Artificial Intelligence at [Iran University of Science and Technology](http://www.iust.ac.ir/). My main research interest lies in `Visual Question Answering(VQA)` and `Vision-and-Language Model(VLM)` under the supervision of [Sauleh Eetemadi](http://www.sauleh.ir/).

Previously, I completed my bachelor's degree at [Iran University of Science and Technology](http://www.iust.ac.ir/) and succeeded in ranking at 5 top students in BSc.
